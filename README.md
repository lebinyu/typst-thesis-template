# typst-thesis-template
This is a [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) template for a thesis.

The main idea is to split each part of a thesis into separate files to avoid a cumbersome main.typ file.
A template.typ include all the styling functions. main.typ is for final compilation.

This template is still under construction.
